    <h2>Summary</h2>
    I am a clever and chic cat. I can do whatever I want if I feel like it. There are countless reasons for you to hire me because I'm an awesome cat. As you can see in my picture I like to use my pink laptop and I code for fun.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    I have a strong will and must do what I want regardless of struggle (like my hooman family's determent). Nothing can't stop me. Also, I am highly passionate of my favorite food, like shrimp and tuna. 
    Almost forgot how patiente I am. I always accompany my family even though they are incredibly talkative. I know when is my time to have treat and value family time.
